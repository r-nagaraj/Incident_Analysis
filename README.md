# ITSM - Incident Management

# Project Summary

### Requirement
Machine learning will improve ITSM processes through prediction and automate the processes

Here is the example:
1. Predict high-priority ticket to take action before: e.g: priority 1 and 2 tickets.
2. incident Forecasting.
3. Assign the tickets to relevent department
4. Predicting tickets which are related to Request for change

### Modeling:
The algorithms that are used: Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost Classifier and Artificial Neural Network. Volume Forecasting is done with the help of Statsmodels & Matplotlib.

The Modeling  done in three parts:
1. Predicting Priority tickets
2. Predict Request for Change 
3. Forecast the Incident Volume:
